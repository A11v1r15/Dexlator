## How to handle the CSV file
- The CSV file used in this project is comma separated.
- Header names with a underline will see the first part as a language and the second part as a variant of it
    - Only the first parts will be in the "From" combobox, when selecting it, the translator will search from all variants of that language 
- Header names with a exclamation point will be hidden and only be utilized to get the names from a language
